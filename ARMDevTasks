Next tasks:
1) Merge building synthetically and for target to one file
 - This requires creating a module initiating all hardware
2) Create power manager that will track the battery-related features of the system
3) Create the motor driver that will simply change the PWM signal (for now)
4) Create an interface to either ROS or BeaglebleBone to send commands
 - It should be ROS compatible interface


As more things are getting implements it will be needed to create a testing manager to capture events and make sure the required events are published
